# Shortcuts

Need to create shortcuts on a Windows computer?  I've got you covered.

## New-OHShortcut

- Create a new shortcut on the logged in users desktop or the Public desktop. 
- Create a new shortcut in the logged in users start menu or the all users start menu.
- Simple to use (See included comment based help)
- Defaults to public in all cases unless told otherwise. (Useful if deploying this via deployment software as SYSTEM eg Intune.)
